   git clone https://github.com/your-username/signals-and-systems-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd signals-and-systems-projects
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   - Ensure **MATLAB R2023a** or compatible version is installed.
   - For Python scripts, install requirements:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     (Note: Create a `requirements.txt` if Python dependencies are used.)

4. **Explore the labs**:
   - Each lab folder contains code, data, and documentation specific to the project.
   - Refer to individual lab READMEs for detailed instructions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **MATLAB R2023a**: For signal processing simulations and visualizations.
