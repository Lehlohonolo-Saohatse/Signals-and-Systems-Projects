# üöÄ Lab 1: Motion Under Gravity

Welcome to the **Lab 1** repository for **ELYM 316 ‚Äì Signals and Systems (2025)**! This project simulates the vertical motion of a ball thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 30 m/s, using MATLAB to plot distance versus time and analyze key physical properties.

---

## üéØ Objective
Using a time step of 0.02 s up to 6.20 s, this lab models the motion under gravity with the equation:
\[ y = v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]
where:
- \( v_{0y} = 30 \, \text{m/s} \) (initial velocity)
- \( g = -9.80 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (gravitational acceleration, taken as negative)

The code also explores a hypothetical scenario with positive gravity.

## üìä Visualizations
Check out the generated plots below:

### 1. Vertical Motion of a Ball
![Vertical Motion](verticalmotion.png)  
This blue plot shows the ball's trajectory, reaching a maximum height before falling back to the ground.

### 2. Hypothetical Motion with "Upward" Gravity
![Upward Gravity Motion](upwardgravity.png)  
This red plot illustrates what happens when gravity acts upwards, resulting in an indefinite upward curve.

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers
| **Question**                              | **Answer**              | 
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| (i) To what maximum height does the ball rise? | 45.9184 m              |
| (ii) What is the index of time at maximum height? | 154                  |
| (iii) How long does it take to ascend to maximum height? | 3.06 s           |
| (iv) How long does it take to hit the ground? | 6.14 s               |
| (v) What happens if \( g \) is positive?    | Upward parabolic curve |

**Explanation for (v):** If \( g \) is positive, gravity acts upwards, causing the ball's height to increase indefinitely in a parabolic trajectory.

## üíª MATLAB Code
The script below generates the plots and computes the answers:
```matlab
% Key variables
v0 = 30;              % Initial velocity (m/s)
g = -9.80;            % Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)
dt = 0.02;            % Time step (s)
t_max = 6.20;         % Maximum time (s)
t = 0:dt:t_max;       % Time array

% Height calculation
y = v0*t + (1/2)*g*t.^2;

% Plot 1: Normal Motion
figure;
plot(t, y, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2);
title('Vertical Motion of a Ball');
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Height (m)');
grid on;

% Maximum height analysis
[maximum_height, index] = max(y);
time_at_max = t(index);

% Ground impact time
ground_index = find(y < 0, 1);
time_to_ground = t(ground_index);

% Plot 2: Positive Gravity
y_pos_g = v0*t + (1/2)*abs(g)*t.^2;
figure;
plot(t, y_pos_g, 'r-', 'LineWidth', 2);
title('Hypothetical Motion with "Upward" Gravity');
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Height (m)');
grid on;

% Display results
fprintf('(i) Maximum Height: %g m\n', maximum_height);
fprintf('(ii) Index at Maximum Height: %d\n', index);
fprintf('(iii) Time to reach Maximum Height: %g s\n', time_at_max);
fprintf('(iv) Time to hit the ground: %g s\n', time_to_ground);
fprintf(['(v) If g is positive, gravity acts upwards, producing a parabolic curve that increases indefinitely.\n']);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. Ensure MATLAB R2023a (or compatible) is installed.
2. Save the code as `motion_under_gravity.m`.
3. Run the script in MATLAB to generate plots and see console output.
4. View the saved graph images (`graph_normal.png` and `graph_positive_g.png`).
