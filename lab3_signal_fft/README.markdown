# 📡 Lab 3: Signal Generation and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)

Welcome to **Lab 3** of **ELYM 315 – Signals and Systems (2025)**! This lab focuses on generating sinusoidal signals at 1 Hz, 5 Hz, and 10 Hz, combining them with noise, and using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to recover the frequency components.

---

## 🎯 Objective
1. Generate 1 Hz, 5 Hz, and 10 Hz signals with amplitudes 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
2. Add the signals together and introduce noise.
3. Use FFTs to recover the frequency components and their amplitudes.

## 💻 MATLAB Code
The script `signal_fft.m` generates the signals, adds noise, computes the FFT, and creates the plots. Run it in MATLAB to reproduce the results.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed.
2. Run `signal_fft.m` to generate the plots and console output.
3. Save the plots as `1hz_signal.png`, `5hz_signal.png`, `10hz_signal.png`, `combined_signal.png`, and `fft_spectrum.png` for inclusion in this README.
